# MagicUI Quickstart Guide

## Installation

MagicUI is a mod like any other Hollow Knight mod for 1.5. This means you ~~can~~ will be able to install it from Scarab. 
You can also get the latest version from https://github.com/BadMagic100/HollowKnight.MagicUI/releases/latest and add it to
its own folder within your mods folder.

More quickstart content coming soon (TM).
